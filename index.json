Initially, it was a manual and time-consuming process requiring expert image editing software skills. With the introduction of AI and machine learning, the process has become automated, faster, and more accurate. The technology uses algorithms to identify facial features in an image, extract them, and superimpose them onto another face while maintaining the original image’s lighting, angle, and expression. The first instances of face swapping were seen in the film industry, where it was used to create special effects. As time passed, the technology became more available and eventually made it into mobile apps and social media platforms, allowing users to swap faces with friends, celebrities, or pets for entertainment. Notable examples include Snapchat’s face swap filter and FaceApp, which have brought face swap technology to the masses. However, the technology’s potential extends beyond entertainment. It has significant implications for security, identity verification, and medical research. For instance, face swapping can protect individuals' identities in sensitive photographs or videos or create realistic avatars for virtual reality environments. On the other hand, more advanced applications of face swapping, such as deepfakes, have raised serious concerns about misinformation, identity theft, and privacy.

This model was designed to recognize and extract facial features from an input image and then superimpose them onto a target face in another photo. However, the demo version of the model was limited to a 128x128 resolution, which, when run on its own, resulted in pixelated and low-quality output images. What sets the inswapper model apart from other face-swapping technologies is its ability to generate high-quality results with just a single input image. This is a significant advancement over other methods, such as training LoRA models and Dreambooth, which require several to several dozen images and are semi-complex to train. Not only do these methods take considerable time to prepare properly, but they also need a substantial amount of computational resources. In contrast, the Faceoff app, leveraging the power of InsightFace’s AI model, can produce near-instant results comparable to these competing options. This is made possible by the advanced algorithms and techniques employed by the inswapper_128.onnx model can accurately extract and superimpose facial features even from a single image. The result is a high-quality face swap that maintains the integrity of the original image while seamlessly integrating the new face. When the demo model was released on GitHub, it attracted an influx of spammers. This unexpected surge prompted the developers to relocate the advanced version of the application to Discord, a more controlled environment. Consequently, the original inswapper_128.onnx file was removed from GitHub. InsightFace has expanded its reach to Discord, a popular communication platform, where they have introduced the InsightFaceSwap bot. This bot allows users to directly experience the power of InsightFace’s face-swapping technology. Users can create stunning, high-quality face swaps of themselves by using the bot in conjunction with Midjourney, a tool for creating personalized portraits. The InsightFaceSwap bot is free and provides an excellent way for users to test face-swapping technology. More information about the bot, including a tutorial on installation and commands, can be found here on InsightFace’s GitHub page. This move to Discord represents InsightFace’s commitment to making its technology accessible to a broader audience and provides a glimpse into the potential future of AI face-swapping technology. .jg-entry img { transition: transform .25s ease-in-out !important; } .jg-entry img:hover { transform: scale(1.1); } if (!jQuery) { alert(\"jquery is not loaded\"); } $( document ).ready(() = { const gallery = $(\"#gallery-b7392e055b2c115cb957e5845dae81ea-2\"); let swipeboxInstance = null; gallery.on('jg.complete', () = { $(() = { $('.lazy').Lazy({ visibleOnly: true, afterLoad: element = element.css({filter: \"none\", transition: \"filter 1.0s ease-in-out\"}) }); }); swipeboxInstance = $('.galleryImg').swipebox( jQuery.extend({}, { } ) ); }); gallery.justifiedGallery({ rowHeight : \"150\", margins : \"5\", border : 0, randomize : false , waitThumbnailsLoad : false, lastRow : \"justify\", captions : false, }); }); ","date":"06-03-2023","objectID":"/posts/face-swapping-with-ai/:0:3","tags":["InsightFace","Face Swap","GFPGAN","Real-ESRGAN","AI"],"title":"Faceoff: A Journey into the World of AI-Driven Face Swapping","uri":"/posts/face-swapping-with-ai/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Improving Image Quality with CodeFormer and Real-ESRGAN To overcome the limitations of the inswapper_128.onnx model, the Faceoff app employs two Python scripts, CodeFormer and Real-ESRGAN. Real-ESRGAN is designed to develop practical algorithms for general image/video restoration. It also incorporates GFPGAN (Generative Face Prior GAN), a script that enhances the quality of face images. GFPGAN uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate high-quality facial images from low-quality inputs, thereby improving the quality of the faces swapped using the inswapper_128.onnx model. On the other hand, CodeFormer, developed by S-Lab at Nanyang Technological University, is used as an alternative option for enhancing the final output. CodeFormer is an advanced tool that uses AI to improve the quality of the final face-swapped image, making the results even more impressive. It’s designed for robust blind face restoration with a Codebook Lookup Transformer, as detailed in their NeurIPS 2022 paper. CodeFormer can be used for various tasks, including face restoration, whole image enhancement, video enhancement, face colorization and face inpainting. It provides a balance between fidelity and quality, with the fidelity weight parameter ‘w’ allowing users to adjust the output according to their needs. By combining these two powerful tools, the Faceoff app can produce high-quality, stunning results from low-resolution outputs. This allows the app to overcome the limitations of the inswapper_128.onnx model and produce face-swapped images that are of much higher quality than would otherwise be possible.

The first step is face detection, where the algorithm identifies the faces in the input images. This is typically done using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are particularly effective at image recognition tasks. Once the faces have been detected, the next step is facial feature extraction. This involves identifying and extracting the key features of each face, such as the eyes, nose, mouth, and shape of the face. These features are then used to create a mask of the face, which can be superimposed onto the target face. The final step is the actual face swap, where the face from the input image is superimposed onto the target face in the other image. This involves aligning the features of the two faces, adjusting the color and lighting to match the target image, and blending the edges of the face mask with the rest of the image to create a seamless result.

You can then use those datasets as prompts for Midjourney, and the AI will generate images that reflect the style or theme of the dataset. To create a custom dataset in Midjourney, you can use the prefer command with the option parameter. Here’s an example: Example /prefer option mydataset This will create a new option called mydataset in your Midjourney account. You can then add images or text to this dataset using the prefer command with the add parameter: Example /prefer add mydataset https://example.com/image1.jpg Example /prefer add mydataset https://example.com/image2.jpg You can also remove items from the dataset using the prefer command with the remove parameter: Example /prefer remove mydataset https://example.com/image1.jpg Once you have created your custom dataset, you can use it as a prompt for Midjourney by including the name of the dataset in your imagine command: Example /imagine model:midjourney-1 seed:mydataset This will generate images based on the images or text in your custom dataset, allowing you to create custom themes and styles for your Midjourney prompts. These advanced Midjourney prompt techniques are just the tip of the iceberg regarding the possibilities of this amazing AI tool. You can create unique, captivating, genuinely unique images by experimenting with different prompts and techniques. VII.
